Refridge
===
ReFridge is an useful fridge management tool designed to help you efficiently manage your food items, reduce waste, and rebuild a healthier relationship with your refrigerator.

Usage
-
**My Fridge**

We provide customizable options to add food types, quantities, and expiration dates. Additionally, we offer a feature that automatically recognizes food items by scanning receipts, making it simpler to manage the contents of your fridge.

**Fridge Recipes**

Based on the ingredients in your fridge, we recommend suitable recipes and add missing ingredients to your shopping list. This provides more ways to utilize leftover food and reduce waste.

**Shopping List**

When shopping, a shopping list is essential. Our shopping list can directly import missing ingredients from your fridge. For staple items, you can set them to be automatically added to the shopping list when they are removed. We also offer a one-click import feature for completed items into your fridge, making it easier to manage recurring ingredients.

**Statistics Charts**

ReFridge offers beautiful statistical charts to help you analyze the types and expiration dates of food in your fridge. It also calculates the amount of food you have discarded or consumed, effectively helping you review your relationship with your fridge. We aim to provide the most convenient fridge management system for you.
